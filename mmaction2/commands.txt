make sure you have data in mmaction2/DataSet/Data
First you run from that specific folder
python filesToRun.py

afterwards you are ready to train!
the command line should look something like "python mmaction2/tools/train.py PathToTSNFile"
so for example in our train we did python mmaction2/tools/train.py filesToRun/videoDataSet/videoDataSetTSNFile.py
you can find other TSN files in the filesToRun folder. if you're train got disturbed and you want to pick it up from where you left it just add "--resume"

Simmilar with test we have done for our specific case (depends also on best epoch number)
python mmaction2/tools/test.py filesToRun/videoDataSet/videoDataSetTSNFile.py work_dir/videoDataSetTSNFile/best_acc_top1_epoch_30.pth

if you want to make data with classification on picture you can simply use -  python filesToRun/classifyVideos.py
and if you want to make data weight less you should do before filesToRun - python filesToRun/reduceDataSize.py

Good luck! and have fun!
